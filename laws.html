  <h1>Astronomical Laws and Theories</h1>

  <div class="section-title">Key Astronomical Laws</div>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>1. Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation</h3>
      <p>This law states that every mass attracts every other mass in the universe with a force directly proportional
	  to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. It explains planetary 
	  orbits and tides.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion</h3>
      <p>Kepler's three laws describe how planets move in elliptical orbits, sweep equal areas in equal times,
	  and follow a relationship between orbital period and distance from the sun. These laws form the foundation
	  of orbital mechanics.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>3. Hubble’s Law</h3>
      <p>This law shows that galaxies are moving away from us, and their speed is proportional to their distance. 
	  It provided key evidence for the expansion of the universe and the Big Bang theory.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>4. Stefan–Boltzmann Law</h3>
      <p>This law relates a star’s luminosity to its surface temperature. It states that the total energy radiated
	  per unit surface area is proportional to the fourth power of the star's temperature.</p>
    </div>
	<div class="card">
      <h3>5. Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum</h3>
	  <p>This law states that if no external torque acts on a system, the total angular momentum of the system remains 
	  constant. It explains why planets spin faster as they contract and why accretion disks form around stars
	  and black holes.</p>
	 </div>
	<div class="card">
      <h3>6. Planck’s Law</h3>
	  <p>Planck’s law describes the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal 
	  equilibrium at a given temperature. It laid the foundation for quantum mechanics by showing that energy is
	  quantized.</p>
	 </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section-title">Key Astronomical Theories</div>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>1. Big Bang Theory</h3>
      <p>This theory proposes that the universe began from a singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago 
	  and has been expanding ever since. It explains cosmic background radiation and galactic movement.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. Nebular Hypothesis</h3>
      <p>It suggests that the solar system formed from a rotating cloud of gas and dust (a nebula). 
	  Gravitational collapse led to the Sun forming at the center, while planets formed from the remaining material.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>3. Theory of General Relativity</h3>
      <p>Proposed by Einstein, this theory redefined gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass.
	  It explains phenomena like black holes, gravitational lensing, and the orbit of Mercury more accurately than Newton’s laws.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>4. Inflationary Theory</h3>
      <p>This theory refines the Big Bang model by proposing a rapid exponential expansion of the universe within
	  the first fraction of a second. It explains the uniformity of cosmic background radiation and the large-scale
	  structure of the cosmos.</p>
    </div>
	 <div class="card">
      <h3>5.  Steady State Theory</h3>
	  <p>This theory proposes that the universe has no beginning or end in time and is always expanding but maintaining 
	  a constant average density. New matter is continuously created to fill the gaps left by the expansion. It was a 
	  competing theory to the Big Bang but has largely been discarded.</p>
	 </div>
	 <div class="card">
      <h3>6. String Theory</h3>
	  <p>String theory attempts to reconcile general relativity and quantum mechanics by modeling fundamental particles 
	  as one-dimensional strings rather than points. In cosmology, it offers potential explanations for the early 
	  universe, including the nature of cosmic inflation and dark matter.
