        <h2>More About The Celestial Objects</h2>
        
        <h3>Stars</h3>
        <p>Stars are massive, glowing spheres of hot gases, primarily hydrogen and helium, held together by gravity. They produce
		light and heat through nuclear fusion reactions in their cores, converting hydrogen into helium. The Sun is the closes
		t star to Earth and the primary source of energy for our planet. Stars vary in size, temperature, color, and brightness,
		and they can live for millions to billions of years depending on their mass.

</p>

  


        <h3>Meteors</h3>
        <p>Comets are icy celestial bodies that orbit the Sun, often in elongated orbits. They are composed of frozen gases,
		dust, and rock. When a comet approaches the Sun, the heat causes its ices to vaporize, creating a glowing coma and a 
		tail that always points away from the Sun due to solar wind. Famous comets like Halley's Comet are visible from Earth 
		
		at regular intervals and have been observed for centuries.

</p>
        <h3>Nebulae</h3>
		<p>Nebulae are vast clouds of gas and dust in space, often serving as the birthplaces of stars. They can form from the 
		remnants of dying stars or from interstellar material clumping together. Some well-known nebulae, like the Orion Nebula, 
		are visible through telescopes and appear in beautiful colors due to the light emitted or reflected by ionized gases. 
		Nebulae can also be regions where new stars and planetary systems are formed.

</p>
		<h3>Galaxies</h3>
		<p>Galaxies are immense systems containing billions of stars, along with gas, dust, and dark matter, all bound together 
		by gravity. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is just one of billions in the universe. Galaxies come in various shapes, such as
		spiral, elliptical, and irregular. They can collide and merge over time, leading to new star formation and changes in their
		structure.

</p>
		<h3>Constellations</h3>
		<p>Constellations are patterns of stars in the sky that have been identified and named by different cultures throughout
		history. They often represent mythological figures, animals, or objects. Though the stars in a constellation may not
		be physically close to each other in space, from Earth's perspective, they appear to form distinct shapes. Constellations
		are useful for navigation and storytelling and serve as a way to map the night sky.

</p>
		
    <h3>Dwarf Planets</h3>
        <p>Dwarf planets are celestial bodies that orbit the Sun and share some characteristics with regular planets but do not meet all the criteria set by the International 
		Astronomical Union (IAU) for full-fledged planets. Specifically, they must orbit the Sun, have enough mass for their gravity to shape them into a nearly round form, and not
		be a satellite of another body. However, they differ from planets because they have not cleared their orbital paths of other debris. As of now, five officially recognized dwarf
		planets exist in our solar system: <b>Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres</b>. Pluto, once considered the ninth planet, was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. Eris, 
		discovered in 2005, is slightly smaller than Pluto but has more mass. Haumea, known for its elongated shape due to its rapid rotation, and Makemake, which lacks an atmosphere,
		are both located in the Kuiper Belt. Ceres, the smallest and the only dwarf planet in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, was the first to be classified as such. 
		Scientists believe that more dwarf planets exist beyond Neptune in the Kuiper Belt and possibly in the Oort Cloud. These celestial objects are essential in understanding
		planetary formation and the structure of our solar system.
</p>
        <h3>Moons</h3>
		<p>Moons, or natural satellites, are celestial bodies that orbit planets, dwarf planets, and asteroids. Earth has one moon, while other planets have many—Jupiter has over 95, 
		and Saturn has more than 146. Some moons, like Ganymede and Titan, are larger than Mercury, while others, like Phobos and Deimos, are tiny. Moons can influence planetary 
		conditions, such as Earth’s tides. Some, like Europa and Enceladus, may have subsurface oceans that could support life. Even dwarf planets, like Pluto, have moons, with 
		Charon being the most notable. Scientists are also searching for **exomoons** beyond our solar system.
</p>
		<h3>Asteroids</h3>
		<p>Asteroids are rocky, airless remnants from the early solar system, primarily found in the <b>asteroid belt</b> between Mars and Jupiter. They vary in size from tiny
		pebbles to nearly 1,000 km across, like <b>Ceres</b>, which is also classified as a dwarf planet. Asteroids are categorized into three main types: <b>carbonaceous (C-type),
		silicate (S-type), and metallic (M-type)</b>, based on their composition. Some have orbits that bring them close to Earth, known as <b>Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs)</b>, with
		a few posing potential impact threats. Occasionally, asteroids collide, sending fragments into space, which may reach Earth as <b>meteoroids</b> and burn up as meteors.
		Some asteroids have moons, and a few, like Bennu and Ryugu, have been studied up close by spacecraft. Scientists believe asteroids contain clues about the solar system’s
		formation and could be future targets for mining valuable resources.
</p>
		<h3>Comets</h3>
		<p>Comets are icy celestial bodies that originate from the <b>Kuiper Belt</b> and the distant <b>Oort Cloud</b>. They are composed of ice, dust, and rock, often described as 
		"dirty snowballs." When a comet approaches the Sun, its ice vaporizes, creating a glowing <b>coma</b> and a long <b>tail</b> that always points away from the Sun due to solar 
		wind. Comets follow highly elliptical orbits, with some taking thousands of years to return. Famous comets include <b>Halley’s Comet</b>, which orbits every 76 years, and <b>Comet 
		NEOWISE</b>, which was visible in 2020. Some comets break apart due to gravitational forces or collisions, and their debris can create meteor showers when Earth passes 
		through their remnants. Scientists study comets because they contain ancient materials from the early solar system, possibly offering clues about the origins of water and life
		on Earth.
</p>
		<h3>Interplanetory Medium</h3>
		<p>The <b>interplanetary medium (IPM)</b> is the space between planets within a solar system, filled with a mix of charged particles, magnetic fields, and cosmic dust.
		It is primarily made up of the <b>solar wind</b>, a continuous stream of charged particles (mainly electrons and protons) ejected by the Sun. The solar wind interacts with 
		planetary magnetospheres and can cause space weather effects like auroras. The IPM also contains <b>cosmic rays</b>, high-energy particles from outside the solar system,
		and <b>micrometeoroids</b>, tiny dust particles from comets and asteroids. The structure of the IPM is shaped by the Sun’s magnetic field, forming the <b>heliosphere</b>
		, a vast bubble surrounding the solar system. The boundary where the solar wind meets interstellar space is called the <b>heliopause</b>. Studying the interplanetary medium
		helps scientists understand space weather, planetary interactions, and the broader dynamics of our solar system.
